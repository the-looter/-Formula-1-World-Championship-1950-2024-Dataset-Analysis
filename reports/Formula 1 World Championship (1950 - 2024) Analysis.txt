🧠 Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze the Formula 1 World Championship dataset (1950–2024) to uncover trends and insights related to drivers, constructors, races, and overall performance statistics.
This analysis helps in understanding how Formula 1 has evolved over the years and which factors influence race outcomes and driver success.

🧩 Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project contains multiple CSV files, each providing different information about Formula 1 from 1950 to 2024:

circuits.csv – List of race circuits and their locations

constructors.csv – Teams participating in Formula 1

drivers.csv – Information about all drivers

races.csv – Details of each race across all seasons

results.csv – Race results for every event

driver_standings.csv – Points and positions of drivers

constructor_results.csv and constructor_standings.csv – Constructors’ performances

lap_times.csv – Lap-by-lap timing data

qualifying.csv – Qualifying session results

pit_stops.csv – Pit stop timing data

seasons.csv – Yearly overview of the Formula 1 seasons

status.csv – Status codes describing race completion or failure reasons

🧹 Data Cleaning Process

To ensure accuracy, the dataset was cleaned and standardized before analysis.
Key steps included:

Handling Missing Values:

Replaced missing or null time values in races and qualifying with 00:00:00.

Removed newline characters (\n) from time columns.

Dropping Irrelevant Columns:

Dropped the “number” column from the drivers dataset due to excessive null values.

Dropped the “points” column in constructor_results where data was incomplete.

Verification:

After cleaning, all datasets were checked for remaining nulls to ensure data integrity.

📊 Data Analysis & Insights

After cleaning, various analyses were performed using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

1. Nationality Analysis

A bar plot created using Seaborn showed that British drivers have the highest participation rate in Formula 1 history.

2. Lap Time Analysis

From the lap_times.csv data:

Fastest Lap: 0:55.404

Slowest Lap: 9:45.712
This highlights the performance differences across tracks and eras.

3. Constructor Performance

From the constructor standings:

The highest performance recorded: 21 wins with 860 points.

The lowest performance recorded: 6 points with 0 wins.
This shows the wide range in competitiveness between top and bottom teams.

4. Season Trends

The seasons.csv dataset helped in analyzing Formula 1’s progression and expansion over time, indicating growth in the number of races and global reach.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization and insights

NumPy – Numerical data operations

🧾 Key Results

The British nationality dominates Formula 1 participation.

Clear identification of the fastest and slowest laps in recorded history.

Constructors’ data shows large point differences, reflecting dominance by top teams.

Clean and structured dataset ready for further predictive or trend-based analysis.

🏁 Conclusion
